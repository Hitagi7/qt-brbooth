IMPORTANT: OpenCV Path Configuration

The OpenCV headers are not being found. You need to update the OPENCV_INSTALL_DIR path in qt-brbooth.pro.

Steps to fix:
1. Find your OpenCV installation directory. Common locations:
   - C:/opencv/build/install
   - C:/opencv/build/x64/vc17/install
   - C:/Program Files/OpenCV
   - Or wherever you installed/built OpenCV

2. Open qt-brbooth.pro and find line 111:
   OPENCV_INSTALL_DIR = C:/opencv/build/install

3. Update it to match your actual OpenCV installation path, for example:
   OPENCV_INSTALL_DIR = C:/path/to/your/opencv/install

4. Verify the path contains:
   - include/opencv2/opencv.hpp
   - x64/vc17/lib/opencv_world4110d.lib (or similar)

5. If your OpenCV uses separate modules instead of world library, you may need to update the LIBS line as well.

6. Rebuild the project in Qt Creator.
